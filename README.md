<b>[Zero to GANs](https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans)</b> is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based Deep Learning Course made in collaboration with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ). <br>
The course instructor [Aaskash N S](https://jovian.ai/aakashns) covers introductory concepts in PyTorch, aswell as regularization methods such as [ResNets](https://towardsdatascience.com/residual-blocks-building-blocks-of-resnet-fd90ca15d6ec), [normalization](https://towardsdatascience.com/batch-normalization-and-dropout-in-neural-networks-explained-with-pytorch-47d7a8459bcd), and many more, that help develop efficient deep neural networks.

The first video lecture of the course can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ioMqzMRFgM&t=1409s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). <br>

## Zero to GANs : Course Project 
![ ](https://github.com/Husain0007/JovianAI/blob/main/Images/cifar-100-sample.png)

For the course project I trained different ResNet models, and one ResNext model to classify images from the [CIFAR100 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The performance measures for the different models have been logged on the Jovian platform. <br>
